## Organisational:
Pretty much anything to do with admin/the unit and not the actual project goes here

[Resources](/Organisational/Resources) is where you will find the templates provided by Michael

[Meetings](/Organisational/Meetings) is where the meeting minutes (and agenda if we end up using agendas) will be going for each week

[Members](/Organisational/Members) is where team member specific things will be going (e.g. time-sheets - there are blank time-sheets in your directory)

I am attempting to track the `.xlsx` files here - obviously they are binary files, so this may end poorly, but hopefully not

### Checklist for Team Manager each week:
Need to submit:

- [ ] Group timesheet file

`TimeSheet_Group3200_04_Current.xlsx` is the current group timesheet - each week the Team Manager will fill this in, and *then* make a copy of it for that week (e.g. named `TimeSheet_Group3200_04_Wk2.xlsx`

Move the old group timesheet into [OldTimeSheets](~/Organisational/OldTimeSheets)

- [ ] Zip/gzip file of booked-hours spreadsheets `Booked_Group3200_04_WkY.zip` or `Booked_Group3200_04_WkY.tar` containing the booked hours spreadsheets (see `/Organisational/Members/*/Booked_Hours_*.xlsx`)

**Make sure that you are collecting the current weeks version for each team member - possibly get them to be sent to the Discord server when people have done theirs for the week**

- [ ] Convert the meeting minute(s) for that week into a PDF

Use [this](https://www.vertopal.com/en/convert/md-gfm-to-pdf) to do the conversion, remember to name the files correctly (`Minutes_Group3200_04_WkY.pdf`. If there was more than one meeting in a week, append a letter after the week, e.g. `Minutes_Group3200_04_Wk1a.pdf`)
